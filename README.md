Othello, also known as Reversi, is a classic two-player board game that offers a deep strategic challenge. In this version, your opponent is based on the Minimax AI algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in games to find the best possible move by considering all available options and predicting the opponent's moves. It seeks to minimize potential losses while maximizing the chances of winning. Othello is easy to learn but provides a compelling gameplay experience. Here's how to play Othello:

Objective:
The objective of Othello is to have the most pieces of your color (either black or white) on the game board when the game ends.

Game Setup:

Othello is typically played on an 8x8 grid (64 squares). The four central squares are initially arranged as follows: two black discs and two white discs form a small square in the center of the board.

Each player chooses a color (black or white). Black usually goes first.

Game Rules:

Players take turns placing one of their discs on the board. To do this, a player must make a move that "sandwiches" at least one opponent's disc between their new disc and another disc of their color.

A legal move must result in flipping (changing color) of at least one opponent's disc. This can happen horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Gameplay:

A player must make a move if they have a legal one. If a player has no legal moves, they must pass their turn. If both players pass consecutively, the game ends.

The game ends when there are no more legal moves available. The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.

Winning:
The player with the most discs of their color on the board when the game ends is the winner. In case of a tie, the game is declared a draw.

Strategies:

Corner Squares: Controlling the four corner squares is crucial. Once you secure a corner, those discs cannot be flipped.
Edge Control: Controlling the edge squares can also be advantageous since they provide stability and fewer opportunities for your opponent to flip your discs.
Mobility: Keeping your options open and limiting your opponent's moves is essential.
Anticipate Moves: Try to anticipate your opponent's moves and plan accordingly to maximize your disc-flipping potential.
Othello is a game of skill and strategy. The more you play, the better you'll become at recognizing patterns, anticipating your opponent's moves, and maximizing your control of the board. It's a classic board game that offers a great balance of simplicity and depth.
